# Auxiliary math library for game development
## Short description:
**This library was made to be used for creation of game engines and in graphics rendering.**  
**The core functional of this library consists of:**
- Vectors for 2, 3 and 4 elements implemented;
- Implemented methods for vectors which are: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, dot product, angle and cosine, magnitude, normalize, scale etc.
- Matrix 4x4 with basic matrix methods implemented;
- All implemented methods are covered with unit tests and proved working;
- Vector for 4 elements is optimised with SSE for Intel and AMD processors and with NEON for ARM processors, increasing computation speed for the methods.
